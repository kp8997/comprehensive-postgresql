-- For any given timestamp, work out the number of days remaining in the month.
-- The current day should count as a whole day, regardless of the time.
-- Use '2012-02-11 01:00:00' as an example timestamp for the purposes of making the answer.
-- Format the output as a single interval value.

select 
date_trunc('month', l.month + interval '1 month') - date_trunc('day', l.month) as remaining
from (select timestamp'2012-02-11 01:00:00' as month) l

-- answer

select (date_trunc('month',ts.testts) + interval '1 month') 
		- date_trunc('day', ts.testts) as remaining
	from (select timestamp '2012-02-11 01:00:00' as testts) ts
