-- Produce a CTE that can return the upward recommendation chain for any member.
-- You should be able to select recommender from recommenders where member=x.
-- Demonstrate it by getting the chains for members 12 and 22. Results table should have member and recommender,
--  ordered by member ascending, recommender descending.
